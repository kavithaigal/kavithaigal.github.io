    Leisure 
    
    WHAT is this life if, full of care,
    We have no time to stand and stare?‚Äî
    
    No time to stand beneath the boughs,
    And stare as long as sheep and cows:
    
    No time to see, when woods we pass,
    Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass:
    
    No time to see, in broad daylight,
    Streams full of stars, like skies at night:
    
    No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
    And watch her feet, how they can dance:
    
    No time to wait till her mouth can
    Enrich that smile her eyes began?
    
    A poor life this if, full of care,
    We have no time to stand and stare.

        - WH Davies

Although I write about how being fast paced is important. Internally I long for a life, where there is calm and no rush. Taking time to just drink in the beauty that nature has to offer is something that needs a serene feeling of the present, which is hard when the mind is continuously focused 5 days into the future and planning and strategizing towards it.

Although this poem tries to focus on the denigration of the human spirit in between the hustle of life. To me, it is a reminder to keep in mind that, even simple things are beautiful, and we need to take a moment to appreciate the small things in life.
Even though I'm not much of a romantic, I try to be a little bit appreciative of the people and faculties around me.
